Thinking of selling your business? Maybe you've typed **"sell my business Singapore"** or **"sell my company Singapore"** into Google a few times, just to see what's out there. Whether you're ready to move on, start something new, or simply curious about what your business might be worth, **timing your exit right can make a huge difference**.

As someone who's worked closely with business owners across Singapore—helping them prepare, position, and sell their companies—here's my take on when it might be the right time to sell, and how to make sure you're getting the best deal possible.

## 1. The Market Matters More Than You Think

One of the biggest drivers of how much your business is worth? **The market**. And not just your own sales — I'm talking about the broader economy and what's happening in your industry.

### Good times = higher valuations
When the economy is doing well, buyers are more active, valuations are higher, and financing is easier to get. If your business is growing and your industry is trending upwards, that's a great time to consider a sale.

### In tough times, deals slow down
When things slow down economically, buyers get more cautious. You might still be able to sell—but you'll need to adjust expectations.

### Bonus tip: Watch what others in your industry are doing
If you're seeing competitors or similar businesses being acquired, it might mean strategic buyers are on the hunt. This could be a smart time to explore your options.

## 2. What Actually Drives Your Valuation?

A lot of business owners ask me, **"How much is my company worth?"** Here's what buyers usually look at:

- **Steady profits** — Are you consistently making money?
- **Recurring revenue** — Do clients keep coming back or pay you monthly?
- **Clean books** — Are your financials easy to understand and up-to-date?
- **Low founder dependency** — Could the business keep running if you stepped away?

The more these boxes you tick, the stronger your valuation will likely be.

## 3. Don't Forget About You

It's not just about numbers. Selling a business is a big decision, and it has to feel right for you.

### Ask yourself:

- Am I still excited to run this every day?
- Do I have a plan for what's next?
- Would I rather have the money now than keep pushing for the next 5–10 years?

If you're nodding along, it might be time to at least start exploring.

## 4. What's Unique About Selling in Singapore?

Singapore is actually one of the more business-friendly places to sell a company. Here's why:

- **No capital gains tax** (in most cases), so more of the sale price ends up in your pocket.
- **A solid pool of buyers**, from local entrepreneurs to overseas private equity firms.
- **A transparent, efficient regulatory system** that makes deals easier to close.

Whether you're running a clinic, a tech startup, or an F&B chain, there's strong demand across many sectors here.

## 5. The Best Time to Sell? When You're Prepared

The worst time to sell is when you're burnt out or the business has started to decline. Ideally, you want to **start planning 12 to 24 months** before you actually want to exit. That gives you time to:

- **Boost your profitability**
- **Systematize operations**
- **Fix any red flags**
- **Find the right buyer**, not just the first one

Selling your business is a process, not an event. The earlier you start thinking about it, the more options (and leverage) you'll have.

## So… Should You Sell Now?

Only you can answer that. But if you've been searching **"sell my business Singapore"** more than once lately, it's probably time to start the conversation.

You don't have to commit to selling right away. Just understand your options, know your numbers, and start preparing—so when the right offer comes, you're ready.
