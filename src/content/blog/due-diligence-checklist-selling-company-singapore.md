# **Due Diligence Checklist for Selling a Company in Singapore**

*What Business Owners Need to Prepare Before a Sale*

If you're thinking about selling your company in Singapore, you've probably come across the term **due diligence**. It's a key step in the sale processâ€”where potential buyers take a closer look at your business to make sure everything is in order before making an offer.

Many business owners start by searching **"sell my company Singapore"** or **"how to sell my business Singapore"** and soon realize that preparation is half the battle. A strong due diligence package not only builds buyer confidence, but also helps you justify a higher valuation and close the deal faster.

This article breaks down the essential due diligence checklist you'll want to prepare if you're selling a small or mid-sized business in Singapore.

## Why Does Due Diligence Matter?

Buyers want to be sure they're getting what they pay for. Due diligence gives them the chance to verify your financials, legal structure, contracts, operations, and risks before they commit to a purchase.

A smooth due diligence process shows that you're a serious sellerâ€”and signals that your business is well-run and ready for transition.

## âœ… Due Diligence Checklist: What Buyers Will Expect

### 1. Financial Information

This is the core of any due diligence process.

- **Profit & Loss (P&L) statements** â€“ at least 3 years
- **Balance sheets and cash flow statements**
- **Tax filings (IRAS)**
- **Accounts receivable/payable aging reports**
- **General ledger and chart of accounts**
- **Normalized EBITDA calculations**
- **Budgets and forecasts** (if available)
- **Any government grants or subsidies received**

**Tip:** Clean, consistent, and clearly explained numbers reduce buyer skepticism and make negotiations easier.

### 2. Corporate & Legal Documents

Buyers want to confirm your business is properly structured and compliant.

- **ACRA BizFile and company constitution**
- **Shareholder agreements and cap table**
- **Board resolutions and meeting minutes**
- **Licenses and regulatory approvals**
- **Litigation history** (past or ongoing)
- **Details of related party transactions**

### 3. Operational Details

This is where buyers try to understand how your business runs on a day-to-day basis.

- **Organizational chart and staff list**
- **Employee contracts, benefits, CPF contributions**
- **Standard operating procedures (SOPs)**
- **Inventory lists, supplier contracts**
- **Customer database and sales pipeline**
- **Lease agreements** (offices, warehouses, etc.)
- **Key software systems or tools used**

**Bonus:** Businesses that run well without relying too heavily on the owner are more attractive to buyers.

### 4. Sales & Marketing

Buyers want to understand where your revenue comes from and how sustainable it is.

- **Top customer breakdown** (revenue by customer)
- **Customer contracts and retention data**
- **Marketing strategies, budgets, and ROIs**
- **Website traffic and social media metrics**
- **SEO rankings, lead generation funnels**

### 5. Intellectual Property (IP)

If your business has built something uniqueâ€”products, software, brand equityâ€”buyers want to know it's protected.

- **Registered trademarks, copyrights, or patents**
- **Brand assets** (logos, domain names, social handles)
- **Software source code or proprietary tools**
- **Confidentiality agreements** with employees or vendors

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Disorganized documents:** Use a clean virtual data room or Google Drive with folders for each category above.
- **Surprise debts or liabilities:** Disclose them upfront. Hidden issues kill deals.
- **Owner-dependency:** If the business relies heavily on you, buyers may worry about transition risk. Start delegating now.

## Final Thoughts: Get Ahead of the Process

Buyers will ask tough questionsâ€”but that doesn't need to be a bad thing. Being well-prepared helps you take control of the narrative, build trust, and justify your asking price.
