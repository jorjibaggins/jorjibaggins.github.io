It's a key step in the sale process—where potential buyers take a closer look at your business to make sure everything is in order before making an offer.\n\nMany business owners start by searching **\"sell my company Singapore\"** or **\"how to sell my business Singapore\"** and soon realize that preparation is half the battle. A strong due diligence package not only builds buyer confidence, but also helps you justify a higher valuation and close the deal faster.\n\nThis article breaks down the essential due diligence checklist you'll want to prepare if you're selling a small or mid-sized business in Singapore.\n\n## Why Does Due Diligence Matter?\n\nBuyers want to be sure they're getting what they pay for. Due diligence gives them the chance to verify your financials, legal structure, contracts, operations, and risks before they commit to a purchase.\n\nA smooth due diligence process shows that you're a serious seller—and signals that your business is well-run and ready for transition.\n\n## Due Diligence Checklist: What Buyers Will Expect\n\n### 1. Financial Information\n\nThis is the core of any due diligence process.\n\n- **Profit & Loss (P&L) statements** – at least 3 years\n- **Balance sheets and cash flow statements**\n- **Tax filings (IRAS)**\n- **Accounts receivable/payable aging reports**\n- **General ledger and chart of accounts**\n- **Normalized EBITDA calculations**\n- **Budgets and forecasts** (if available)\n- **Any government grants or subsidies received**\n\n**Tip:** Clean, consistent, and clearly explained numbers reduce buyer skepticism and make negotiations easier.\n\n### 2. Corporate & Legal Documents\n\nBuyers want to confirm your business is properly structured and compliant.\n\n- **ACRA BizFile and company constitution**\n- **Shareholder agreements and cap table**\n- **Board resolutions and meeting minutes**\n- **Licenses and regulatory approvals**\n- **Litigation history** (past or ongoing)\n- **Details of related party transactions**\n\n### 3. Operational Details\n\nThis is where buyers try to understand how your business runs on a day-to-day basis.\n\n- **Organizational chart and staff list**\n- **Employee contracts, benefits, CPF contributions**\n- **Standard operating procedures (SOPs)**\n- **Inventory lists, supplier contracts**\n- **Customer database and sales pipeline**\n- **Lease agreements** (offices, warehouses, etc.)\n- **Key software systems or tools used**\n\n**Bonus:** Businesses that run well without relying too heavily on the owner are more attractive to buyers.\n\n### 4. Sales & Marketing\n\nBuyers want to understand where your revenue comes from and how sustainable it is.\n\n- **Top customer breakdown** (revenue by customer)\n- **Customer contracts and retention data**\n- **Marketing strategies, budgets, and ROIs**\n- **Website traffic and social media metrics**\n- **SEO rankings, lead generation funnels**\n\n### 5. Intellectual Property (IP)\n\nIf your business has built something unique—products, software, brand equity—buyers want to know it's protected.\n\n- **Registered trademarks, copyrights, or patents**\n- **Brand assets** (logos, domain names, social handles)\n- **Software source code or proprietary tools**\n- **Confidentiality agreements** with employees or vendors\n\n## Common Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Disorganized documents:** Use a clean virtual data room or Google Drive with folders for each category above.\n- **Surprise debts or liabilities:** Disclose them upfront. Hidden issues kill deals.\n- **Owner-dependency:** If the business relies heavily on you, buyers may worry about transition risk. Start delegating now.\n\n## Final Thoughts: Get Ahead of the Process\n\nBuyers will ask tough questions—but that doesn't need to be a bad thing. Being well-prepared helps you take control of the narrative, build trust, and justify your asking price.\n\nIf you're seriously thinking **\"I want to sell my company in Singapore,\"** start working on your due diligence checklist today. Even if you're not planning to sell immediately, having your house in order makes you more agile and sale-ready whenever the opportunity arises.\n\n## Need Help Preparing for a Sale?\n\nAt **East Street Advisory**, we work with business owners across Singapore to guide them through the sale process—starting with a solid due diligence package.\n\n**Email us at contact@eaststreetadvisory.com**"},"slug":"due-diligence-checklist-selling-company-singapore","is404":false},"data":{"post":{"id":"2","title":"Due Diligence Checklist for Selling a Company in Singapore","slug":"due-diligence-checklist-selling-company-singapore","excerpt":"What Business Owners Need to Prepare Before a Sale","author":"Hui Ng","publishDate":"2025-06-30","readTime":"10 min read","tags":["Due Diligence","Business Sale","Singapore","M&A","Legal Compliance","Financial Preparation","Sell my Company"],"featured":false,"coverImage":"/due-diligence-checklist-selling-company-singapore-cover-picture.png","metaDescription":"Complete due diligence checklist for selling your business in Singapore.
